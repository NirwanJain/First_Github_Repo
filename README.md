# Shape Generator – Java Console Application

This project is a **menu-driven Shape Generator application** developed using **Core Java**.  
It allows users to generate different **patterns and designs** in the console by selecting options from a menu.

The program focuses on **logic building**, **pattern programming**, and **structured coding practices**.

---

## 🔹 Features

The Shape Generator supports the following patterns:

1. Hollow Diamond Pattern  
2. Solid Diamond Pattern  
3. Hourglass Pattern  
4. Butterfly Pattern  
5. Cross (X) Pattern  
6. Hollow Pyramid Pattern  
7. Palindrome Number Pattern  
8. Binary Triangle Pattern  
9. Checkerboard Pattern  

Users can:
- Select a pattern using a serial number
- Specify the number of lines (with input validation)
- Continue generating patterns or exit the program

## 🔹 Concepts Used

This project is built using **core Java concepts only**:

- Loops and nested loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Switch-case  
- Methods and modular programming  
- Scanner class for user input  
- Input validation for better user experience

## 🔹 How the Program Works

1. The program starts with a welcome message.
2. The user types **"start"** to access the pattern menu.
3. A list of available patterns is displayed.
4. The user selects a pattern using a number (1–9).
5. The corresponding pattern is generated in the console.
6. The user can choose to continue or exit the application.

## 🔹 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:
- Improve **logical thinking**
- Practice **pattern-based problems**
- Strengthen understanding of **loops and control flow**
- Write clean and reusable Java code

This project is especially useful for **beginners and first-year students** learning Java.
